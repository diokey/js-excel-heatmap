# js-excel-heatmap

Js Excel Heatmap is library for creating heatmap table in Javascript. Pretty much like heatmap in Excel.

It basically helps you colorize a table with a background color depending on the cell value.

# wiki
The project wiki is [here](https://github.com/diokey/js-excel-heatmap/wiki)

# Usage

Zero Config

The library exposes ExcelHeatMap object globally.

You can just pass the selector of the table that you want to colorize.

It's as easy as 

```
ExcelHeatMap.init('#table1 td');
ExcelHeatMap.render();
```
